packages to use : winston logger http-status-codes,swagger swagger-ui-express

- Use gzip compression.
- Donâ€™t use synchronous functions.
0 Do logging correctly (for debugging, use a special module like debug, for app activity use winston or bunyan).
- Handle exceptions properly, using try-catch or promises.
- Ensure your app automatically restarts by using a process manager or use an init system like systemd or upstart.
- Run your app in a cluster. You can increase the performance of a Node.js app greatly by launching a cluster of processes (a cluster runs multiple instances of the app, distributing the load and tasks among the instances).
- Cache request results, so that your app does not repeat the operation to serve the same request repeatedly.
- Use a load balancer to run multiple instances of it and distribute the traffic, like Nginx or HAProxy.
- Use a reverse proxy that performs supporting operations on the requests. It can handle error pages, compression, caching, serving files, and load balancing among other things.

### HTTPS

1.Generate a self-signed certificate

```bash
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert

```

2.Enable HTTPS in Express

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var fs = require('fs')
var https = require('https')
var app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('hello world')
})

https.createServer({
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server.cert')
}, app)
.listen(process.env.PORT, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000! Go to https://localhost:3000/')
})

```
